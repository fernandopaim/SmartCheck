TODO
-----------------------------------------------
* Rename Reduce to SmartShrink

* Use [GHC generics](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/generic-programming.html)
  instead of SubTypes class.

* Collect failed tests as preconditions until we reach a fixed point.

* Use shrink instances as default for base types.


Not sure how to do
-----------------------------------------------
* Replace (a -> Bool) properties with Testable properties.
  
  * Not quite sure how to do this...


Done
-----------------------------------------------
* ~~Rename examples/Test to examples/MutRecData~~

  * ~~Rename it in the README, too.~~
